Performance modeling is crucial for compiler optimizations, yet existing cost models often suffer from
inaccuracies and limited applicability across different architectures. This paper introduces an automated 
toolkit designed to improve the precision of cost models for basic blocks in assembly code. We propose an 
LLVM-based method for efficient basic block extraction, overcoming the limitations of existing dynamic 
tracing tools. Our toolkit also includes a robust profiling tool that benchmarks basic blocks across 
multiple architectures, ensuring minimal measurement variance. Additionally, we present a dataset 
construction tool that converts basic blocks into graph-based representations, suitable for deep 
learning models like Graph Neural Networks. Our contributions pave the way for more accurate and 
versatile performance models, thereby enhancing compiler optimizations.
